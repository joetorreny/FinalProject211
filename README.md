Blog Application

The first thing program does when its executed is creating database,then creating 3 tables(user, post, category) 
and inserting 3 users with username and password(admin password, admin1 password1, admin2 password2).

The next step is login page, if user is save in session then we redirect to dashboard, program waits for you to 
enter username and password and if correct(i.e one from 3 entered users) then program redirects you to dashboard

On dashboard page you can see posts for user that logged in. There are many things user can do like manupulation
of posts(i.e add, delete, edit, publish, unpublish). Here you can show/hide un published posts and go to category
page.

Category page is simple page for manipulation on categories.

Its a brief explanation of project, this info and everything else like details, architecture, style, models can be
found in code.
